#### How view work :

- Views is controlled by file view.js,
- Logic is controlled by Controllers,
- Access datas is controlled by Models.
- main.js directed user actions and details.


Entry point is js > main.js

main.js call "js > view to display datas on the pages.

View use differents Classes for datas and use the controllers to fill its elements.

Controllers and Classes can use the models files for pick datas in "database".

database is in js > models. files contains only function who return "raw datas" or aggregates datas.
